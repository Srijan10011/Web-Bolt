# Troubleshooting Database Connection Issues

## Problem: Data not loading after 2-3 page refreshes

This issue is typically caused by database connection problems or authentication state management issues. Here are the solutions implemented:

### 1. Environment Variables
Make sure you have a `.env` file in your project root with the following variables:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url_here
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
```

### 2. Connection Health Checks
The app now includes:
- Automatic connection health checks
- Retry mechanisms for failed database operations
- Visual connection status indicators
- Better error handling and user feedback

### 3. Authentication State Management
- Improved session persistence
- Better error handling for auth state changes
- Automatic profile creation for new users

### 4. Retry Logic
- Database operations now retry up to 3 times with exponential backoff
- Connection status is monitored every 30 seconds
- Users can manually retry failed operations

## Common Solutions

### If data still doesn't load:
1. Check your browser's network tab for failed requests
2. Verify your Supabase project is active and accessible
3. Ensure your environment variables are correctly set
4. Try clearing your browser's local storage and cookies
5. Check if your Supabase project has the required tables (products, profiles, orders, etc.)

### If you see connection errors:
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify your Supabase project URL and API key
3. Ensure your Supabase project is not paused or in maintenance mode
4. Check your browser's console for detailed error messages

### Performance Tips:
1. The app now caches data for 5 minutes to reduce database calls
2. Connection status is shown in the header (green wifi icon = connected, red wifi-off icon = disconnected)
3. Failed operations can be retried by clicking the retry button

## Development Notes

The app now uses:
- React Query for better data fetching and caching
- Exponential backoff for retry attempts
- Connection health monitoring
- Improved error boundaries and user feedback
